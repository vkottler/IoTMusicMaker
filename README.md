# IoTMusicMaker
My first IoT project with Arduino and Spark Core.

The JSON used in myJavascript.js was not written by me, here is where I got it:
https://github.com/hpssjellis/spark-core-web-page-html-control.git

This project also must be run with a web server client running that can compile php, otherwise it might not look how it is supposed to.
I could have written it without php, but I was also testing out some of the features of xampp using this project as a medium.
